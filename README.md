# FullStack-Website
Web Engineering Course Final Project


This Website is a full stack website with a log in/home/and admin page. it also has a backend database that stores log in information as well as a
salting and hashing algorithm to protect passwords. 

The homepage has a simple script to change the background on keypress as well as a logout button.
The admin page displays a table of all users in the users table as well as their encrypted password.
I also added a function to save that tables information into a text file where the passwords are also still encrypted.
