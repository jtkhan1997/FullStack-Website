Lab2.php = reg and login page
admin.php = admin page
homepage.php = home page
infoSQL.php = connects to database and validates users/stores them in database
lab2.mysql = database dump
style.css = style sheet

Extra Credit: Salt and Hash: Managed to save hash and display it in table in admin page
	      Single Page: Could not make it a single main page, I managed to get reg/log in to be in one page without
	      having both on screen, but I tried to apply that same method to everything else by making the submit
	      button just a 'button' and run a javascript to do the validation, but it got really confusing and convoluted
	      but I did try.
